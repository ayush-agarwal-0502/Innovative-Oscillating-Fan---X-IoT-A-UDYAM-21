# Innovative-Oscillating-Fan---X-IoT-A-UDYAM-21

## Introduction : 
Skills: Electronics, Arduino , Proteus(Circuit Designing and simulation software), Mechatronic System Designing. 
This project " Innovative Oscillaitng Fan " secured 3rd position in X-IoT-A UDYAM'21 (See Leader Board here : https://www.udyamfest.com/leaderboard ). I participated in my first year in this event. The team had 3 members : me ( Ayush Agarwal), Sandeepan Ghosh and Bhavna Chavan . 

Here is the site link for the PS1 and PS2 :

This Github post is more concerned with the PS2 , since it involved making this "innovative oscillating fan" project .

# About the project :

The basic idea behind this project which I thought is that we can automate the process of setting the direction of oscillating fan towards ourselves , by using an Infrared sensor to detect us, stop in our direction , and keep oscillating when it can't detect us . This I have achieved using Arduino, L293D , and infrared sensor . My teammates furthermore added a Blynk sensor to make the fan controllable via phone too . We made the circuit for this fan on Proteus . 

## Addons :
I have also made a multi person version for this fan , just the idea part myself . This accomodation in the original model makes the fan suitable even when multiple people are standing in front of it . It is availaible at this link :
