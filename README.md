# Innovative-Oscillating-Fan---X-IoT-A-UDYAM-21

## Introduction : 
Skills: Electronics, Arduino , Proteus(Circuit Designing and simulation software), Mechatronic System Designing. 
This project " Innovative Oscillaitng Fan " secured 3rd position in X-IoT-A UDYAM'21 (See Leader Board here : https://www.udyamfest.com/leaderboard ). I participated in my first year in this event. The team had 3 members : me ( Ayush Agarwal), Sandeepan Ghosh and Bhavna Chavan .
